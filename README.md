### Execute Plugin

```
mvn twitch-release:twitch-release
```


## Setup Api Token

Before the plugin can be used an API token has to be generated.

See Twitchs [documentation](https://authors.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens)
   
Once the Api token is generated it can be stored inside the maven `.m2/settings.xml`.
 
 ```xml
<server>
  <id>twitch-token</id>
  <passphrase>token</passphrase>
</server>
```

Make sure to use `passphrase` instead of `username`and `password` otherwise the plugin will not be able to recognize the token.

It is also possible to set the token with the parameter `token` directly inside the plugin configuration. This is however not recommended because those pom files are usually getting commited into source control and potentially leaking the token.

## Test

Basic tests can be executed with:

```
mvn test
```

Tests are kept basic because for most of the functionality the Twitch backend is required.

## Development

##### IntelliJ Run Configurations

The project contains IntelliJ run configurations that can be used for most tasks. Create a folder `runConfigurations` inside the `.idea` folder and copy over all run configurations. 


##### Build Project

twitch-release-maven-plugin

```
clean install
```

#### Create a Release

In maven `settings.xml` configure the ossrh account

```
<server>
  <id>ossrh</id>
  <username></username>
  <password></password>
</server>
```

#### Build and Release 

```
mvn clean deploy -P deploy
```

#### Move Staging to Release

If `autoReleaseAfterClose` is set to false in the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` plugin an additional step is required to move the deployment from staging to release.

```
mvn nexus-staging:release
```

Or if the deployment didn't workout you can drop the artifact from the staging repository.

```
mvn nexus-staging:drop
```

**Note:** On MacOS the error `gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device` can be solved by setting the tty export variable for gpg.

```
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```

If you are using the IntelliJ console this might need to be set directly in that console.

##### Run Example

The example can be used for testing of the plugin during development. It requires some manual setup on GitHub before it can be run.

* Setup twitch token

twitch-release-maven-plugin/example

```
clean install
```

Executing the plugin from a different folder won't work without also fixing the path to the release notes and any additional assets configured.

**Note:** The example module is deliberately not included as default module otherwise it would execute each time the project is built.
Instead the module can be considered separate and independent. It is an example of how to use the plugin and it is helpful in testing the plugin during development.


##### Checkstyle

twitch-release-maven-plugin/plugin

```
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

##### PMD

twitch-release-maven-plugin/plugin

```
mvn pmd:pmd
```

## Help

#### Upload disappeared on Twitch

Twitch seems to remove invalid uploads after a short while. You should usually get an email from twitch that informs you about the status of your upload. Note that this plugin does not in any way verify what you upload to twitch is valid. The validation is completely left to twitch.
